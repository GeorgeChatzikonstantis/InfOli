This is a sample readme in order to force
git to keep the structure of the repository
as intended.

/run/output is intended to hold all output
files for an experimental run. Note that
typically, any experiment results in:

1) a file detailing somatic voltage levels
for every neuron, per simstep. Typically there is
one file per MPI rank employed (for MPI-based runs)
2) some form of performance tracking results, whether
by Unix time calls, Intel VTune profiling or inline
gettimeofday function calls
