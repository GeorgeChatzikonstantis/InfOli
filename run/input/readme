This is a sample readme in order to force
git to keep the structure of the repository
as intended.

/run/input is intended to hold all input
files for an experimental run. Note that
typically, any experiment needs:

1) the infoli executable (infoli.x)
2) the connectivity matrix (cellConnections.txt)
3) the OpenMP runtime library (necessary for OpenMP-based runs)
4) the applied input current file (optional)
5) a file detailing the g_cal parameter of each neuron (optional)
