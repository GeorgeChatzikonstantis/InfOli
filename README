Welcome to the repository of the InfOli Project.

This project aims at designing a high-performance
simulator for the Inferior Olivary Nucleus. It was
specifically designed with the Intel Xeon Phi (KNC)
platform in mind, but is expected to work on any
x86-based architecture.

~~~~~~~~~~

Structure:
/src holds the source code for the simulator. Notice
that the code is, for the moment, accelerated under 3
distinct programming models, MPI, OpenMP and a hybrid
of the two. The makefile distinguishes between making
for the phi accelerator and the Xeon (or any x86-based)
processor. Example of usage: make omp_phi, compiles
and links the simulator for the phi platform, under the
OpenMP coding paradigm.

/tools holds generators for input to the InfOli simulator.
A connectivity matrix (/connectivity) is imperative for
any simulation, while an applied current (/iapp) is optional.
Example of usage: make pct, compiles a connectivity matrix
generator that is based around fixed percentages of network
density.

/scripts holds queuing and bash scripts. This folder is
mostly useful when using the simulator on one of the
supercomputing clusters that it has been tested on. One
particular example is the STFC Hartree Center idataplex
cluster. For this particular cluster, a sample script for
each programming "flavour" of the simulator is given.

/run is the folder where input and output of any experimental
run is intended to be held. There is also a folder with runtime
libraries, different for each supercomputing cluster where the
simulator has been run on (to account for different compiler
setups).

The Project is the fruit of collaboration between
Microprocessors and Digital Systems Laboratory(MicroLAB),
National Technical University of Athens(NTUA)
(http://www.microlab.ntua.gr/)
and
